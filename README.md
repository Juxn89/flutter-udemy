## ✨ Widget Showcase

Here's a brief overview of some of the custom widgets you'll find in this repository:

| Widget | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CustomCardType1` | A simple card with an icon, title, and description. | Ideal for displaying a list of features or options in a clean and organized way. |
| `CustomCardType2` | A card that showcases an image with a descriptive text below it. | Perfect for photo galleries, news feeds, or any content that is image-centric. |
| `CustomInputField` | A themed and reusable text input field with validation. | Simplifies form creation and ensures a consistent look and feel across your app. |

### ListView vs ListView.builder

| Feature | `ListView` | `ListView.builder` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use Case** | Best for a small, fixed number of items. | Ideal for long or infinite lists of items. |
| **Performance** | Renders all items at once, which can be inefficient for large lists. | Renders items lazily as they scroll into view, providing better performance. |
| **Implementation** | You provide a list of widgets directly to the `children` property. | You provide a builder function that creates items on demand. |
